# Weather App Fullstack Challenge

This project is a submission for the Fullstack Challenge, showcasing a user list with real-time weather data. Built with Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, it integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather details based on user locations. The application uses Redis for caching weather data to ensure itâ€™s no older than 1 hour, improving performance and reducing API calls. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design, and the project includes comprehensive setup instructions for Docker, project dependencies, and running tests. Error handling ensures graceful degradation during API failures, and unit tests validate both backend and frontend functionality.
